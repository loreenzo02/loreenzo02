# Hi! I'm Alejandro Lorenzo 🙋‍♂️ and I ❤️ hard work.

# Programming languages

I've worked with C, Python, Java, Javascript, a lot of frameworks like Django, Flask, Vue.js and Neo.js. Moreover, I have experience with databases development using Postgres and Dveaber, I love it 😍.

In addition, I love the Blockchain and Web3 world and I am working to be a good backend developer in this world. 📚

# My personal programming projects

I have personal projects in addition to my university workload, but due to time constraints, I can only work on them intermittently.

· I followed the [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) tutorials to do this projects. I'm a self-taught person.
