# My personal projects

I have personal projects in addition to my university workload, but due to time constraints, I can only work on them intermittently.

¬∑ I followed the [buildspace](https://buildspace.so/) tutorials to do this projects.

- üñº[BuildspaceNFTS](https://github.com/loreenzo02/BuildSpace_NFTs): I created NFT's with this project and I learned how they work. (ABANDONED)
- ü§ñ[TravelAI](https://github.com/loreenzo02/Travel-AI): This is an AI based on text-davinci-003 technology from OpenAI. This send prompts to the api and the AI creates you a travel itinerary. (ABANDONED)

¬∑ Taking part of [Empathy](https://www.linkedin.com/company/empathyco/) Academy Progam I created some project en different phases:

- üí™üèº[GymTonic](https://github.com/Tiberiuss/GymTonic): GymTonic is a CRUD App that we developed in the Empathy Academy program. This app is capable of managing user logins and registrations. It displays information about the various exercises that users can perform in the gym, allowing users to create routines with these exercises and "complete" them by setting the weights and repetitions performed for each exercise. It also enables users to track their progress over time for each exercise performed.
- üó∫Ô∏è[GeoMap](https://www.linkedin.com/events/empoweringmerchants-mappingdata7115280283012128770/comments/): GeoMap is a visualization tool for marketing teams that is useful to identify biases and understand the interactions between customers and the catalogue.
GeoMap uses both geographically located and non-geographically located information to display Key Performance Indicator (KPI) information, such as the number of clicks or the number of items added to the cart. It also allows for the filtering of this information based on numerical and percentage ranges in order to make the search for rare values easier.
Lastly, GeoMap also aids the marketing teams in searching for the synonyms that are more widely used in each community thanks to its synonyms search functionality, which is integrated in the search bar. Thus, whenever a user searches for a particular query, the top synonyms for that query will be displayed.
