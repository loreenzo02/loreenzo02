# Hi! I'm Alejandro Lorenzo 🙋‍♂️ and I ❤️ work hard.

# Programming languages

I've worked with C, Python, Java, Javascript, a lot of frameworks like Django, Flask, Vue.js and Neo.js. Moreover, I have experience with databases development using postgres and Dveaber, I love it 😍.

In addition, I love the blockchain and Web3 world and I am working to be a good backend developer in this world. 📚

# My personal programming projects

I have personal projects in addition to my university workload, but due to time constraints, I can only work on them intermittently.
